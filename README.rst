Description
===========

The ``QconCATquantSTAR.py`` script allows the quantification of endogenous proteins for which a QconCAT internal standard was spiked-in. add more information

Usage
=====

DDA input table information

The QconCAT input table (.CSV file) should have the following structure including headers. The ``FullPeptideName`` column should have the sequence of each peptide included in the QconCAT internal standards, the ``ProteinName`` column should have the UniProt identifier of the endogenous protein of the corresponding peptide sequence, and the ``Concentration`` column should have the spiked-in concentration of each QconCAT peptide. An appropriate concentration unit would be fmol/Âµg total protein, since the spiked-in QconCAT protein and the corresponding QconCAT peptides have equimolar concentration. The unit of concentration used in the QconCAT input table will be the unit of concentration in the output table with the quantified endogenous proteins.

================ ============= ================
FullPeptideName  ProteinName   Concentration
================ ============= ================
sequence 1       UniProt ID 1  concentration 1
sequence 2       UniProt ID 2  concentration 2
...              ...           ...
sequence N       UniProt ID N  concentration N

An example QconCAT input table is located in the ``Examples`` folder as ``QconCATinfo_example.csv``.

command example:

::

    python QconCATquantSTAR.py -i ./Examples/DDA_PeptideGroups_example.csv -Q ./Examples/QconCATinfo_example.csv
    
The output will be generated at ``QconCATproteins.csv``. The output is formatted with the following column headers: ``ProteinName`` (UniProt identifier of the quantified endogenous protein) and ``conc_sample{X}`` (concentration of the quantified endogenous protein). There will be as many columns with concentrations as there are samples.
